    <h3>A Little Bit About Me...</h3>
    <p>I'm a marketer by trade, recently moved to the city of Chicago. Back in the olden days (2008) I learned a bit about web coding, and I'm hoping to get back into it. I have a lot to learn, especially since I first learned my rudimentary skills before responsive design was a big deal. I'm excited though! I was always drawn to the digital side during my marketing gigs, and I hope to make a full career transition.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I'm unashamed to admit I am a cat lady, and always have been. Low maintenance, fuzzy and cuddly...it doesn't get better than that. I also live to travel, and recently took a trip to Slovenia and Croatia. If you, dear reader, are a fellow nerd, know this: I visited King's Landing.</p>
    <p>Anyways, I know this site is pretty basic... ideally I'd add a lot more bells and whistles, and that's what I hope to learn in the upcoming WDI course. I see this as an opportunity to finally and fully dive into my passion.</p>
